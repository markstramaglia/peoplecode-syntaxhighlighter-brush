<h2>Use with Confluence Code Macro</h2>
<p>
Atlassian Confluence has a Code Macro which can be used to display formatted code blocks on Confluence pages.  This macro uses the open-source "SyntaxHighlighter" Javascript library by Alex Gorbatchev, and as of version 2.1.0 of the Code Macro Plugin, supports the upload of custom language definitions, or "brushes".
</p>
<p>
If you are running version 2.1.0 or better of the Code Macro in Confluence, you can upload this PeopleCode brush file from the Confluence Add-on configuration page for the Code Macro plugin.
</p>
<p><b>To upload a new language definition to Confluence</b>:
<br/>1. Access the Confluence administration console and select "Configure Code Macro" from the menu on the left.
<br/>2. At the bottom of the page, click the "Upload new Language" link and then select the language definition file to upload in the dialog that appears.
<br/>3. Your new language definition will be available for use immediately from within the code block macro.
